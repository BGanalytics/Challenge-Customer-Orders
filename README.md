# Challenge-Customer-Orders
Amalgamation of data from different tables and aggregating data USING SQL

Challenge: Customer data is in two different tables. We need to find out how much each customer spend in total, together with their information. 

My approach: Using LEFT OUTER JOIN to join the tables and extraxt the required information. Using SUM to obtain the total expenditure, and ORDER BY to create the list of customers from highest to lowest expenditure.
